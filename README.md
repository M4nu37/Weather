# Weather
It's a weather web application which displays the current weather and the forecast for the next four days.

It works by using two different AIPs. The first one, is from https://openweathermap.org, and its funcition is to provide the data for the current weather and the forecast for the next few days. 

Then there is the second API, that is from https://docs.microsoft.com, and its used to display the time depending on the city.
